TASK
Sometimes you need to compare lists of number, but sorting each one normally will take too much time.
 Instead you can use alternative methods to find the differences between each list.

Challenge

The arrangements of the two arrays were random, Numeros was very proud of his arrangements. Unfortunately,
some numbers got left out of List A. Can you find the missing numbers from A without messing up his order?
